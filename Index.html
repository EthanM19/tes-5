                    <p>I primarily use a DSLR camera with a variety of lenses to capture different scenes and moods. The camera I have been using is the FX30 from sony. Its a cinema line mirrorless camera. even though its meant for videography, it is a great camera for pictures as well. With the FX30 I also use a Rhode boom mic thats mounted to the top. It allows me to catch great audio.</p>
